- network manager protocol, RecipeModel, imageCacheManager, imageLoader were implemented for showing the major components and architecuters.
- ObserableObject were used rather than Obserable. Both comfortable.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
 - major component and architectures was focused rather than UI details, since good architecure impacts the long-term overall app evolving.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
 - 4 hours around, most time spent for network layer, caching and image loader with canceling when scrolled down and test cases.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
 - this is just the simple sample app, not full size app, simplicity was focused and full feature like full dependency injection and env variables, etc.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
- functionality seems sounds but detail decoration of UI could be added and there might be some corner case that was not taken care of.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
- fun experience with sample app, looking forward to contributing your app.
